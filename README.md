## General Information
The task of this project was to create a Flask library app with the following
specs:

- Include a functional navigation bar
- A landing page
- A sign-up page. When the user signs in, their login credentials are stored in
a user datable in ElephantSQL and assigned a unique ID and token
- A login page. Authenticated users are able to log in to the page
- Autenticated users are able to view their profile page that displays their
email and person access token

Overall, the purpose of the project was to practice creating a database in 
ElephantSQL, storing user input in the database, and accessing the database for
logging in.

## Project Status
Project is:  _complete_ 

## Room for Improvement
The project has lots of room for improvement, including:

- Creating a frontend that actually makes use of the car table created in
this app. Right now, users are only able to create an account or login and view
their user token. Creating a frontend utilizing the CRUD opertions would allow
users to actually view the car inventory content and add, delete, and edit contact.
- Improve the design of the car inventory app.
- Allow users to update their profile information, like their email address.
